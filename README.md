# And_Digital_Test
This Repo will consist of my code solution for the technical test set by AND Digital.


### Tech Test

- Terraform a load balanced web front end in AWS, GCP or Azure.
- The solution should incorporate a number of elements
- There should be a minimum of 2 instances and they need to be able to scale across availability zones.
- Ideally the web page should be secure.
- The Vpc should be appropriately split into the required subnets.
- The hosts should be running Linux and the choice of web server is down to you. The use of modules would be a good step but the focus should be on good terraform structure.â€‹
